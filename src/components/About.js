            <p>My name is Teddy, and I’ve been using Airbnb as a traveler since 2012. In 2014, I began Airbnb-ing my apartment room in Brooklyn when I went traveling. In 2017, my wife and I took the plunge and purchased a property in the Hudson Valley in New York, with the intention of Airbnb-ing it out a couple of weekends a month in order to subsidize our mortgage. </p>

            <p>Just one year after that purchase, we were awarded ‘Superhost’ status by Airbnb, and booking demand for our house increasingly grew. In 2021, Airbnb asked me to become a Superhost Ambassador (even featuring me in their ads), offering me a chance to consult and help people become new hosts at no cost to them. </p>
